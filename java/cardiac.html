  <br>
  <h2><a>INVENTED</a></h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">By : Netscape Communications Corporation<br> Date : May to December 1995</p>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications and part of the ex-Mosaic team, had the vision that the web needed a way to become more dynamic. Animations, interaction and other forms of small automation should be part of the web of the future</p>

<div  style="height: 600px;margin-left: 200px;" id="AREA"><br>
  <h2><a>USED IN AREAS</a></h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">1. Web Applications (Frontend) - JavaScript is the defacto standard for client side web development.<br><br>
  2. Web Servers (Backend) - With the advent of Node JS, JavaScript is a very popular choice for highly scalable Backend Servers due to its non-blocking nature.<br><br>
  3. Mobile Applications - HTML/JS/CSS can be used to develop mobile applications. Apache Cordova can be used to develop cross platform mobile applications that work with iOS, Android and Windows Mobile devices.<br><br>
  4. Desktop Applications</p>
</div>


<div  style="height: 600px;margin-left: 200px;" id="rate"><br>
  <h2><a>USED WIDELY</a></h2>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">JavaScript remains the most popular choice. In fact, the list has changed little since the last rankings in January:<br>
    1. JavaScript<br>
    2. Java<br>
    3. PHP<br>
    4. Python<br>
    5. C#<br>
    6. C++<br>
    7. Ruby<br>
    8. CSS<br>
    9. C<br><br><br>
    1. JavaScript being a dynamic programming language, it is widely accepted by most of the web browsers so that the interaction at client side with the user is made more interesting and more easier.<br>
2.JavaScript also allows your page to be interactive. You can add animations into the page which either attract attention to a specific part of the page or which make the page easier to use.You can provide responses within the web page to various actions that your visitor takes so as to avoid the need to load new web pages to respond.<br>
3.Considering the performance , JavaScript is fast and Reliable.<br>
4. Other Functions can be rewritten and can be executed at the client side by using JavaScript.<br>

      <h2><a>LIBRARIES MOST USED</a></h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
          <b>React</b> is a view library that provides an API for rendering your HTML via JavaScript .  It is highly declarative and promotes the reuse of code through the building of components that manage their own data and the state of that data.  It provides you with a terrific model to follow in order to build reactive web interfaces.
        <br> <b> JSX</b> provides a mechanism for writing HTML-like syntax that gets converted into JavaScript functions that React can understand.  It gives you a very intuitive and declarative syntax that feels like HTML and provides you with a mechanism for interacting with what React calls the Virtual DOM (an in memory representation of the DOM).
          <br>query, you will know that one of the biggest bottlenecks of that system is how hard it gets to keep the DOM in sync with your javascript.
         <br> <b>Redux</b> works with <b>flux</b> to provide you with a mechanism for managing your application's state in a predictable manner and Flux is a new take on how data should flow through your application </p>
